					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<h5>Home Away from Home</h5>
					<p>Hostay is a unique website that helps students and working individuals
						find their ideal choice of stay. We have various options for individuals to choose from and filter our stays according to their preferences..<br>
				 <br>
				 Hostay was created to be a one-stop solution for everyone looking for hostels and PG'S. We also help them in pre-booking their stay of choice on our website. Hostay also provides numerous hostels for the students to choose from. Our website takes no commission. We also offer reviews of the people that have stayed in a particular hostel.
				 In a student's life, their college phase is the most influential in shaping their personality. And that's why where they decide to stay first when they land in a new city is very important. They should feel comfortable and safe; our website does precisely that. It helps students choose whichever hostel they want according to what they like.
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 Hostay also partners with top tier residential buildings to ensure there are no backlogs when it comes to quality checks and balances. We also make sure all the hostels we have partnered with are thoroughly checked before certifying them. We also provide random inspections every few months to make sure that the quality remains up to standards all year round.
